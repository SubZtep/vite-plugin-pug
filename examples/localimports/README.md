# :paw_prints:

A basic example of how to use this plugin with **multiple pages** with relative pug imports, including **Pug locals**.

Bootstrapped with the TypeScript variant of vanilla Vite template with the following command.

```sh
$ npm init @vitejs/app
```

To try out install dependencies and start the local server.

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

Open up http://localhost:3000/ and close down when you finish. :mushroom:
